# PC-Polygon
PC Polygon aims to be a modular hardcore survival game set in a dystopian future. We aim to feature in-depth and accurate systems and immersive gameplay, whilst remaining fun. The game will be open world and allow the players to choose what they do, team with others or fend for themselves. Lore shall not have a major focus but shall present avid players with the opportunity for speculation. The map will primarily be natural but with pockets of human civilisation, or whatever is left of it spoiling the surrounding area. Players lose their sanity as they use more man-made items with “the pollution”, this leads to their perception of the world is skewed and them seeing a darker, twisted version of life. 

## Prerequisites
This game is built in Unity, so as of now you'll have to have the latest Unity Editor installed.

## Installing
Right now we do not have any official releases, so you'll be able to download the project files directly from GitHub. You will have to build the game in it's current state if you really want to play it.

## Background
The following chunks of information should help you understand our vision.

### World Background
The game is set several centuries in the future, in a world where the mistakes humans are making in our day are almost a forgotten memory. In the past, the Earth increased in global warming, making most of the areas in proximity to the equator completely uninhabitable. Most of the Earth's population died out, as well as most of the animal species. The southern hemisphere was still completely uninhabitable, as it was either fully arid, and above temperatures humans could survive at, or barren, frozen and devoid of life, places such as Antarctica. The ice caps melting had made most of the coasts underwater, reducing land for humans to live on. The remnants of humankind migrated north as areas like Scandinavia and northern Russia had climates close to Mediterranean temperatures. As industry around the world had shut down as humans became more self-sufficient, and advanced technology and fabrication reduced the need for timber and large factories as, most of Europe became covered in dense forests, crawling with a brand new ecosystem, born from the hardiest species that survived the mass extinction, which brings extreme risk to exploring forests. Nature reclaimed most of the earth’s ancient cities, strewn with advanced old-world tech and non-perishables, all corrupted with the memory and old technology of that era. This corruption was a virus, both physical and technological, which was filled with the collective memory of Earth at the time, designed to make the humans of old feel more at home in their dying world. This was a convenience in the past, but now, it is a corruptive influence, infecting everything from the old world, making the user feel out of place, driving them to a dystopic, perverse insanity.
